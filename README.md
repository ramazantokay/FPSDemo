I created this FPS project with Unreal Engine 4.19. It is my free time project during my summer holiday. I have an opportunity to experience Unreal Networking (Replication) system, Weapon projectile system and GameMode, HUD etc.
You can play with your friends.

Desc:
Two guards protect their sphere and your mission is that you will get the sphere to the extraction zone. While doing this, you have to hide from them. You can distract them by shooting. You can play the game with yourself or your friends. Have a good game!

I did this project with the help of this tutorial. https://www.udemy.com/unrealengine-cpp/learn/v4/overview

Created with C++ and Blueprint.
